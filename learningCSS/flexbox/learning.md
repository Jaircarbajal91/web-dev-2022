# Flexbox
 - Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns.

 - Flexbox allows developers to align items in a responsive way.
 - There are two axis we need to know. Main axis and cross axis.

 ## Flex Sizing Properties
 - `flex-basis` Defines the initial size of an element before additional space is distributed
 - `flex-grow` Controls the amount of available space an element should take up. Accepts a unit-less number value.
 - `flex-shrink` If items are larger than the container, they shrink according to flex-shrink.
