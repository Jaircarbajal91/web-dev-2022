 ## Media Queries
  - As mobile divices and tablets became widely available, developers had a problem.. how do we create websites that look good on all screens?
  - We can create one website and one stylesheet that is able to respond to different device sizes and features.
  - The way this is possible is through media queries.
  - Media queries allow us to modify our styles depending on particular parameters like screen width or device type.
